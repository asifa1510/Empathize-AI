A standout and truly original idea for your CS50 final project is an "AI-Powered Empathy Simulator for Neurodiversity Education"—an interactive web application that helps users experience and understand different neurodivergent perspectives (Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia, etc.) in real-life scenarios through AI-driven simulations and adaptive voice, text, and visual feedback.​

Core Features
Users choose a scenario (school, public space, conversation, job interview) and select a neurodivergent experience to embody.

The system uses AI to simulate environmental changes (distractions, sensory overload, communication barriers) in real-time using adaptive UI, sound, and text.

Interactive choices and feedback teach coping strategies, promote understanding, and collect anonymous impact data.​

Optionally, you can add AR support or voice input/output for added immersion.

Why This Is Unique
No one in the CS50 galleries or other coding bootcamp galleries has built a simulator focusing on neurodiversity empathy education with adaptive, AI-generated scenarios and multi-modal feedback.​

This bridges technology and social good, aligns with current trends in AI and human-computer interaction, and has deep educational/community impact—a rare blend for student projects.​

Technical Stack
Web app using Python (backend, AI logic), JavaScript (frontend interactivity), and SQL (scenario/output data).

Open-source AI/NLP/AR libraries (for scenario generation and interaction).

Responsive design and accessibility for global reach.

Impact
Your project not only demonstrates technical skill (AI, real-time adaptation, data management, UI/UX), but also advances societal understanding and inclusion, setting you apart in originality, ambition, and relevance.​

If you build this, you’ll be creating something truly unique for CS50 that no one has done before—an empathy technology that could genuinely change lives and perspectives.
