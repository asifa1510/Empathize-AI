**AI-Powered Neurodiversity Empathy Simulator**

**Overview**  
> An interactive web application that helps users experience Autism, ADHD, and Dyslexia through real-life scenario simulations.  
> Adaptive visuals, sound, and text changes recreate sensory overload, attention shifts, and reading challenges.

**Features**  
> Scenario selection (school, public space, conversation, interview).  
> Simple UI effects: blur, jitter, distortion.  
> Subtle audio changes: background noise, voice overlap.  
> Interactive choices with AI-adjusted responses and brief feedback.  
> Optional AR or voice input/output for added immersion.

**Tech Stack**  
> Python (Flask), JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQLite.  
> Optional: Web Speech API, Tone.js, lightweight NLP/AI for dynamic scenarios.

**Novelty**  
> This project introduces empathy technology—a rarely explored area in student projects.  
> Instead of providing information *about* neurodiversity, it offers direct, simulated *experience*, helping society understand sensory overload, attention difficulties, and reading barriers in a human, accessible way.  
> By blending AI, interaction design, and inclusivity, it fills a gap in educational tools and supports greater societal understanding and acceptance of neurodivergent individuals.

**Purpose**  
> To promote empathy, awareness, and inclusion by allowing users to step into neurodivergent perspectives through immersive, accessible simulations.
